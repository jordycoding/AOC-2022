Make a new tree without any parent, the root tree.
Set it as the current TreeNode and keep track of the current Node
- Every time cd changes directories you create a new TreeNode
  - You set the parent of this node to the current node
  - Then you set this node as the current node
- cd .. simply sets the current node to the parent of the current node(so it goes up one spot in the tree)
Every line that is not a command is output of ls in this case
So for every line that is not a command you match it to a size regex(something like (\d+).*))
Every time this matches you add it to a sum you keep track of outside of the loop
When the command cd changes directories you set the size of the current node to the one kept track of in size
Because ls is called in every directory this will populate all nodes with a size
